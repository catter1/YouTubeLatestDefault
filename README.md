A recent YouTube update has added the "For you" sorting option to videos and shorts. Are you annoyed that by default, the "For you" option is selected, rather than "Latest"? Quite understandable!

When enabled, this extension automatically changes the sorting option of videos and shorts to "Latest". That's it.

## Installation

1. Grab the zip file from the latest release attachments
2. Unzip it onto your machine
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. At the top right, enable "Developer mode"
5. At the top left, click "Load unpacked"
6. Select the folder of which you unzipped the extension into

I have also submitted this to the Chrome Marketplace. If accepted, will be available through there!

## Notes

This is my first experiment with Chrome Extensions. It may not be the best way possible, but I thought I'd have fun, and share it with others!
